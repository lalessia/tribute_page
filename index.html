        <div class="containerAphorisms">
          <div class="aphorism"><p>That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal, as time will show.</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science.</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>Those who have learned to walk on the threshold of the unknown worlds, by means of what are commonly termed par excellence the exact sciences, may then, with the fair white wings of imagination, hope to soar further into the unexplored amidst which we live.</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>I am never so happy as when I am really engaged in good earnest, & it makes me must wonderfully cheerful & merry at other times, which is curious & very satisfactory</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>Mathematical science shows what is. It is the language of unseen relations between things. But to use and apply that language, we must be able fully to appreciate, to feel, to seize the unseen, the unconscious.</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>I am much pleased to find how very well I stand work & how my powers of attention & continued effort increase.</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>I believe myself to possess a most singular combination of qualities exactly fitted to make me pre-eminently a discoverer of the hidden realities of nature.</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.</p></div>
          <div class="aphorism"><p>Those who incline to very strictly utilitarian views may perhaps feel that the peculiar powers of the Analytical Engine bear upon questions of abstract and speculative science rather than upon those involving everyday and ordinary human interests.</p></div>
